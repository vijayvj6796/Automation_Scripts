Cannot extend the folder quota_fs, if extended by force then data gets erased.
cannot mv the folder
if the folder name is changed, then the quota is for the folder will be delleted automatically.

Usage

There's 3 required flags:

    -m for mountpoint, aka the directory which you want to limit
    -s the size to which you want to limit in bytes
    -f filesystem. If you're not sure what this should be, just stick with ext4 or ext3

Here's an example of how I used this script to create ./quoted_dir limited to 1 MiB (that is 10242 in Binary Prefix )

"sudo ./mklimdir.sh -m ./quoted_dir/ -s $((1024*1024)) -f ext4"
